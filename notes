QUERY
- query has two parts. title and description.
- title: general description
- description: more in depth. But there are some irrelevant words which always appear, like "relevant documents will describe". Thus word rarity is very important. idf.
- Thus need to filter out all the junk. 

DOC
- important fields: title, abstract, 
- unknown: Kind Code? Family Members (similar docs), IPC class, group etc., UPC
- vague words to enlarge scope of patent
- kind code: not important in determining relevance. Can mean first pub/second pub,  kind of patent doc (utility? Design?) 

EVAL
- precision = relevant_ret / (relevant_ret + not relevant_ret)
- recall = relevant_ret / total relevant


ENHANCEMENTS
- 2-grams indexing to expand query. 1-gram expansion only if the word is rare.
- IPCCAT

- need to cleanly separate tp and fp. Right now there are interspersed

PLACE MORE WEIGHT ON QUERY TITLE. Explain why not doc title later on
- modify tf-idf
- need to have at least 4 terms in query title. 

QUERY EXPANSION
- take top 20% of documents. 
- for each doc, generate top 10 non stop words
- pick the top 10 from the pool.
- run query
